### Project Middleman ###
Through Linuxtoday, I found a project called "Linux Middleman".

A quote from it's main page:

```
Parallel Shell Scripting Made Easy

The Middleman System (mdm) is a set of open-source utilities that help you parallelize your shell scripts. Its features include:

Uses dynamic mix-n-match parallelization technology
Requires minimal modification to existing scripts
Provides ncurses-based monitoring console
The Middleman System is what you need to unleash the power of your multi-processor and multi-core computers.

```

Middleman uses a different approach to accomplish the same thing as PPSS: parallel processing using shell scripts. It seems that Middleman focuses on parallelising tasks within existing shell scripts. PPSS on the other hand just executes entire scripts or commands in parallel.

Use the tool you need. So take a look at the following link to learn more about Middleman:

### "parallel" ###

Seems also very useful. Written in Perl. See:
