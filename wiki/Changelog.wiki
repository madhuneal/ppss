#summary Changelog of distributed PPSS
#labels Featured
=== 2.56b (BETA) ===

  * Changed license from BSD to GPL. 
  * Renamed ppss.sh to just 'ppss' to make it more like a regular Unix command.
  * The -d (directory) option now works differently. The option operates recursively, thus also processing all files within sub directories. This is the default. Recursion will be disabled as an option (which is not present yet).
  * Fixed a bug that prevented PPSS from properly handing files with special characters or paths.
  * Added an example script to svn that transcodes flac to mp3 in parallel using PPSS.

=== 2.50  ===

  * Created a unit-test script using shunit2.
  * Reworked the process management code. Management of child processes within a shell script is always a hassle. It could occur that when PPSS was interrupted and aborted with ctrl-c, some spawned processes would continue to run until finished. PPSS now identifies all processes by their ppid and pgid and kills the appropriate processes when ctrl-c is invoked.
  * Reworked some file name parsing issues.
  * A mistake prevented nodes from setting up a single SSH 'channel'. So every time a node wants to lock an item, an SSH connection must be made and teared down, which is too slow. This regression is now fixed.

=== 2.41 ===

  * Fixed some stupid bug that prevented distributed PPSS from functioning.

=== 2.40 ===

  * All usage screens have been overhauled to make it more readable.
  * Reworked the distributed stuff.
  * PPSS now keeps track of processes and kills them gracefully.
  * Bugs in process handling have been removed.

=== 2.34 ===

  * PPSS now works on Solaris if Bash is installed.
  * PPSS can now be run simultaneously within the same directory. If multiple instances are started of PPSS with the same arguments, they work together. If other arguments are used, they work separately.
  * Cleaned stuff up a bit.

=== 2.31 ===

  * The status screen in distributed mode is now working properly again.

=== 2.30 ===

  * PPSS now operates fully asynchronous. There are no polling mechanisms, every action is almost realtime. 

=== 2.21 ===

  * Fixed bug in new mechanism for detecting multiple PPSS instances. (My fault).

  * By default now PPSS creates a directory 'ppss' in the current working dir of PPSS. 
   By using 'export PPSS_DIR=/some/dir' you can change the directory used.

=== 2.20 ===

  * PPSS did not take into account that different users can run PPSS on a single system. This has been fixed. Thanks to Cinly Ooi

  * If a user is starting another instance of PPSS, the second instance will abort unless the -F option is specified. 
Please note that if you run multiple instances of PPSS under the same user account, all instances will process items but fail to terminate.

  * Improved error reporting.

=== 2.19 ===

  * Improved filename sanitization. 

  * Fixed typo.

=== 2.18 ===

  * PPSS now also record CPU model of Mac OS X devices.

=== 2.16 ===

  * Cleaned up output to screen.
  * Deployment of ppss to nodes uses a single SSH connection for file transfer.
  * Deployment of ppss to nodes is done in parallel. 

=== 2.15 ===

When using PPSS in distributed mode, it is now possible to obtain the status of individual nodes.

  * Also, the ; character is now supported in filenames. 

=== 2.14 ===

Major rework on path and filename handling. Filenames are now properly sanitized for special characters such as ',& and ( ). 

Also, PPSS recreates the directory structure of the source location of files, based on the -f option.

=== 2.10 ===

Fixed important bugs when using an input file instead of an input directory. 

=== 2.09 ===

Fixed important bug: when deploying a key must be used to logon to the nodes using scp.

=== 2.08 ===

Fixed some bugs...

=== 2.07 ===

  * User can now specify the known_hosts file with option -K. The fact that a known_hosts file must exist when distributing PPSS to nodes was not documented. 

=== 2.06 ===

  * Forgot to update the version number within the script.

=== 2.05 ===

  * Deployment of PPSS to nodes is now performed in parallel, by executing the deploy function with &." 
  * It is now possible to specify the output directory and/or output filename within the -c option.

=== 2.04 and older ===

I didn't realise that a changelog might be relevant until 2.05.
