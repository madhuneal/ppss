- Also, the ; character is now supported in filenames. 

=== 2.14 ===

Major rework on path and filename handling. Filenames are now properly sanitized for special characters such as ',& and ( ). 

Also, PPSS recreates the directory structure of the source location of files, based on the -f option.

=== 2.10 ===

Fixed important bugs when using an input file instead of an input directory. 

=== 2.09 ===

Fixed important bug: when deploying a key must be used to logon to the nodes using scp.

=== 2.08 ===

Fixed some bugs...

=== 2.07 ===

  * User can now specify the known_hosts file with option -K. The fact that a known_hosts file must exist when distributing PPSS to nodes was not documented. 

=== 2.06 ===

  * Forgot to update the version number within the script.

=== 2.05 ===

  * Deployment of PPSS to nodes is now performed in parallel, by executing the deploy function with &." 
  * It is now possible to specify the output directory and/or output filename within the -c option.

=== 2.04 and older ===

I didn't realise that a changelog might be relevant until 2.05.
