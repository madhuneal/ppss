PPSS Roadmap.


= Details =

  * The distributed mechanism basically requires some script to be written in order to be able to upload content back to the server. This shouldt not be a requirement. The same must be accomplished by just using the -c command line option. 

  * Better status monitoring of nodes. Nodes should periodically write some status information to the server, that can provide some insight in the current status of the jobs that are running.

  * I am considering to add the option to specify a hosts that acts as the SSH fileserver. The PPSS master host and fileserver must be the same host currently. This should not be necessary.
