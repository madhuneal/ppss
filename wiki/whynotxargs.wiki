#summary Won't xargs do the same?.

= Introduction =

It is suggested that the command 'xargs' - that is often found on unix-like systems by default - does exactly the same as PPSS does when used with the -p option. 

In it's most basic form, this is true to some extend. Xargs processes items and keeps an x number of jobs running in parallel. I think that there may be cases that xargs is sufficient for your task at hand. 

`$ touch 10 15 20 25 30 35 40`
`$ ls -1 | xargs -n1 -P 4 sleep`

The additional value of PPSS is that it: 

  * provides logging (for free)
  * provides a progress indicator
  * is simpler to use (my own opinion) 
  * does not process items that already have been processed if interrupted. 

However, use the tool that best fits the job at hand.
